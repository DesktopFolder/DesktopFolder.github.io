This video aims to provide a high-level, practical & somewhat comprehensible explanation of the mechanics behind piston-based bedrock breaking, and how they combine to allow for it to take place. Deciding whether or not it succeeded is an exercise left to the viewer. There are previous and more in-depth explanations of several of the mechanics in this video; if you're interested, please see the References section below.

A written explanation is available at https://desktopfolder.github.io/videos/piston-bedrock-breaking/explanation.html and may be updated/upgraded later as time and energy permits.

Little postmortem:
I was somewhat excited to try my hand at doing an explanation video for this, as tutorials, guides, and different teaching methods in general are something that interest me a fair amount. There were a few things that I think I didn't properly account for. Although doing this video unscripted allowed me to finish it in a not horrific amount of time, it did make it very clear how difficult it can be to explain something 'on the fly'. Another problem is that several of the mechanics here only really exist as 'general knowledge' theoretically backed by a couple people's in-depth knowledge of the codebase, but don't really have defined ways of explaining/talking about them (or good resources). Overall, the biggest success of this video (in my opinion) was probably the block events demo, as using carpet for this made the actual mechanics much simpler to visualize (and would have been pretty handy a year ago...)
