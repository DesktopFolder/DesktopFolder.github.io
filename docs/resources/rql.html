# Introduction

Ranked Query Language (RQL) is a custom "query language" (i.e., a programming-style language that enables making queries of data) available through the RankedQueryBot Discord bot.

Because the query language can be difficult to learn and use, the bot also has a few helper commands. These are listed after **Quickstart**, under **Helper Commands**.

Current helper commands (Updated December 2024):

`/average_completion` -> Gets you the average completion time of a player.
