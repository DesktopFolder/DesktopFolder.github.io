### Open Qualifiers Rules

#### Important: Although the server may not enforce these rules, they must be followed or your open qualifier submission may not be accepted.

### Draft Settings Rules

- You **must not** set any of the seeds. The seed filter will generate all 3 seeds for you automatically.
- You **may** use any number of gambits. To uncap the amount, set "Max Gambits" to a high value (e.g. 20)
- The draft **must be** singleplayer (mostly for technical reasons haha)
- You **must** select the "Open Qualifier Submission" box in the settings (so that it says "Yes")
    - Ideally, show drafting on stream, so that any potential issues can be properly resolved.
- You **must not** use the pick timer (it is internally disabled, so it won't do anything)

### While-Drafting Rules

- You may pick **at most**:
    - **Three (3)** picks per **6-pick pool** (i.e., 3 picks each from tools, misc, and early game)
    - **Two (2)** picks per **5-pick pool** (i.e., 2 picks each from advancements, biomes, and armour)
    - Taking more picks than allowed from a pool will immediately disqualify the attempt.
- Once you have decided on your picks and gambits, select "Finish drAAft" to start the attempt. The run will be timed from this point to when the server receives your 80th advancement.
    - Apologies for the hardware gap. Future open qualifiers will hopefully resolve hardware gap issues.

### General Rules

- You may submit **at most** five (5) open qualifiers attempts. If more than 5 are submitted, only the first 5 will be considered.
- Runs must take place after **Midnight (EST) December 26, 2025**
- Runs must take place before **Midnight (EST) January 11, 2026**
- Runs **must be** streamed. You may send the stream link and/or VOD in the #streams channel of the drAAft Discord.
- Runs will be timed by **server RTA**. That is, from when you click "Finish drAAft" to when the server receives receipt of your 80th advancement.
- **DO NOT LOAD OTHER WORLDS WHILE PLAYING YOUR OPEN QUALIFIER MATCHES** thanks <3

### Notes

- A leaderboard will be made available at some point (not immediately due to time limitations)
